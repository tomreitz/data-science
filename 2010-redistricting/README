This project is trying to determine the number of voting-age Americans who were affected by 2010-cycle Congressional redistricting

The main script is compare-congress.py, but you'll also need to run:

pip install fiona
pip install shapely
pip install geopandas
wget https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/CD/108/tl_2010_us_cd108.zip
wget https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2014/CD/tl_2014_us_cd114.zip
wget http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010DP1/Tract_2010Census_DP1.zip
unzip tl_2010_us_cd108.zip
unzip tl_2014_us_cd114.zip
unzip Tract_2010Census_DP1.zip
